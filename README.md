# ChatGPT AutoExpert: Elevating Conversational AI to Expert Level

## Introduction
ChatGPT AutoExpert is a shockingly effective set of custom instructions aimed at enhancing the capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo conversational models. These instructions maximize the depth and nuance in responses while minimizing general disclaimers and hand-holding. The ultimate objective is to provide users with accurate, context-rich information and an improved learning experience.

## Features

### ("Standard")
- **Maximized Depth and Nuance**: Receive high-level, in-depth responses without compromising on the granularity of the information.
- **Minimized Hand-Holding**: Cut through the noise and get straight to the facts, reducing unnecessary disclaimers.
- **Explicit Reasoning**: Your AutoExpert doesn't just provide answers; it offers an explanation, detailing the thought process behind each response.
- **Self-Questioning**: Designed to question its assumptions, and iteratively refine its responses for maximum clarity and accuracy.
- **Resourceful Links**: Automatically generates inline links for related topics and "you may also like" topics, helpfully linked to Google search results to avoid hallucination (GPT-3.5 still hallucinates here, but not always. GPT-4 is rock-solid).

### ("Developer Edition")
- **Verbosity Selection**: Easily choose the complexity of the generated code, from compact "code golf" type responses, up to complex, modular code samples
- **Understands Your Stack**: One mention of your platform, front-end libraries, or language, and the AutoExpert will prime every response to maximize the chance of getting useful code on the first try.
- **Powered by Jupyter**: ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis already runs a Jupyter kernel under the hood. AutoExpert (Developer Edition) comes with a companion Python script that you simply upload to your conversation, and automatically take advantage of the sandbox Python environment for editing longer code samples.
- **Save Your Work**: Among other `/slash` commands, AutoExpert (Developer Edition) will save all your code snippets, dehydrate its memory of your requirements and the work it's doneâ€”even back up the code cells themselves. Then it zips it up, and you can quickly download your coding conversation history.
- **File and Symbol Tree**: By keeping a running history along with a file/symbol tree at the end of each response, ChatGPT will always remember what it just did, and you'll always see what files still need work. It's even smart enough to handle breaking down complex requirements in a way that allows it to write code over multiple turns.
